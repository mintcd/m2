\begin{frame}{Conclusion and Future Work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item RNN and Reinforcement Learning can actually learn something in the scheduling context.
    \item Further experiments can be performed on minutely dataset.
    \item The combinatorial problem when more than one task is submitted at the same time also needs to be studied.
  \end{itemize}
